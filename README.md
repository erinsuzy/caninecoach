# Canine Coach

Capstone Project for LaunchCode's Liftoff Program

Canine Coach is an app for dog trainers and dog guardians. The app allows dog guardians to search for dog training courses that fit their needs and to register for the classes. It also allows dog guardians to create a profile and add a picture of their dog. Dog guardians can also "favorite" classes for future reference, i.e. a puppy who is active may be a good candidate for agility classes in the future, but needs to finish basic obedience class first. The app also allows guardians the ability to contact the trainer through a form in case they have questions. 

For the trainer, this app allows for class curriculum to be centralized and consistent.  It allows dog trainers to offer training courses, both public and private, and to write and post blogs. A relational database makes it easy for trainers and guardians to find information quickly. 

The app was written with React and JavaScript for the front end and Java for the back end. MySQL Workbench is the relational database. Google Classroom was used as the external API, but has been removed as it is wasn't a good fit for the purposes of this project.
